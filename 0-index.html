            <h2>Protecting Our Environment for the Future</h2>
            <p>The environment is the foundation of all life on Earth. From the air we breathe to the water we drink,
        nature provides us with everything we need to survive. Unfortunately, human activities such as pollution,
        deforestation, and overuse of natural resources are putting our planet at risk.</p>
            <p>Protecting the environment is not just the responsibility of governments or organizations—it’s something
        each of us can take part in. Simple actions like recycling, reducing plastic use, saving energy, and planting
        trees can make a huge difference when practiced by many people.</p>
            <p>If we act together today, we can ensure a cleaner, greener, and healthier planet for future generations.
        The time to care for our environment is now.</p>
